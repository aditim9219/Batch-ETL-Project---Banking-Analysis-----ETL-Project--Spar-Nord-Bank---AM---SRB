# ETL-Project--Spar-Nord-Bank---AM---SRB

This project serves as a comprehensive test of knowledge in batch processing tools, focusing on Apache Sqoop, Apache PySpark, Amazon S3, and Amazon RedShiftâ€”industry-standard tools. Centered on a real-world scenario from the banking sector, the task is to construct a batch ETL pipeline. This pipeline will entail reading transactional data from RDS, transforming it, and subsequently loading it into Redshift Tables. Additionally, executing analytical queries on the loaded data to fulfill the project requirements.
